Miscellaneous stuff. 
Talking heads
Let's see... the Overseer, Tandi, Aradesh, Killian, Gizmo, Butch, Harold, Loxley, Decker, Jain, Set, Harry, Cabbot, Rhombus, Vree, Maxson, Nicole, the Lieutenant, Laura, Morpheus, the Master. That's a lot of talking heads! 
Bugs
Some bugs that I've experienced or uncovered in v1.2 (localized bugs that affect gameplay are covered in the walkthrough):

Saving the game near an irritable person and loading can cause them to attack "unprovoked". For instance, I saved the game after Kalnor had warned me that I shouldn't enter Junktown at night. When I loaded he was hostile, apparently thinking he had given me a warning and time to back away. Saving in combat mode while in the Hub and loading can cause the guards to attack, but if you immediately reload the same save they might not.

Saving in the middle of combat can also cause critters to sequence before you upon reloading, effectively giving them an extra turn.

Died of radiation sickness for no apparent reason while resting in the Brotherhood.

NPCs go "apathetic" during some battles and don't seem to think it's that important to attack whomever you're attacking.

Once I killed everyone in the Brotherhood and still got the good ending for them.

Some large bookcases are technically two pieces of scenery (as pointed out by Kahgan, the reason for this is so the whole bookcase can display properly with regard to perspective), and if you happen to click the wrong one your character fiddles with it only to generate a message saying it's too heavy to pick up.

Razlo threw a Flare at me in Shady Sands that got stuck in its "airborne" animation frame and remained there even after I left and returned. I've also a couple of times thrown Flares into walls and had to run to the other side of the wall to pick them up.

I rested in the Skum Pitt until 2 p.m. when Neal runs to open the door, then rested again until the Skulz showed up, and triggered the scripted sequence. Neal started walking from the door to get behind the counter, leaving the Skulz time to finish their part of the sequence and walk out of the bar. When Neal arrived behind the counter he drew his gun and blasted the moving Skul at maximum range through a closed door.

A couple of fighters stood about in Gustofer's ring, and hovering the mouse pointer over them would yield the description "Desk". When the next fight started, the new challenger appeared in the wrong position, so that both fighters were punching at air.

You were supposed to be able to fix the Saul/Trish relationship by talking to Saul first, then telling Trish she must let him keep on fighting if he wants to. This would have been done by talking to Trish in her room in the Crash House, for which there are several dialogue nodes - but all the time she's there, she's asleep and incommunicable.

On several occasions Ian has refused to follow me around on the Junktown casino map. This is likely related to the Dogmeat following bug, the guard allegiance bug, the Lars duplication bug, the boxing display bug, crashes and/or other strange goings-on reported as having taken place on this map - scripts simply tend to break down here. (Note how on the town map it's represented by a green triangle.)

If a party member dies while walking through a red forcefield in the Military Base, they may leave a frozen "death by electricity" animation frame behind, or even complete their movement animation and leave a standing corpse. Meanwhile their stuff is dropped on the ground in the forcefield, unless violence is set to none or minimal.

If you talk to Nicole more than once while stupid, you get a voice sample along with her floats until you've been in conversation with someone else. More like an oddity than a bug, perhaps.

The inventory window only displays the first three digits of weight carried, e.g. "104" if you are carrying 1040 pounds of goods. You'll never reach that kind of figure unless you barter an inordinate amount of heavy things from someone.

The Follower invaders use Brotherhood combat taunts.

If a critter dies from Super Stimpak damage while performing a fidget animation, it momentarily drops to the ground, then repeats the animation and leaves a standing corpse.

You can close a door while standing in the doorway, and then step in either direction like a Schrödinger's Vault Dweller.

The reserve movement command in combat works only if you don't press down Ctrl until your turn has begun, which is not how you normally expect meta keys to function.

Katja is the only NPC with skill points in Energy Weapons, but she doesn't have the ability to use any of them. Ian and Katja both have useless skill points in Big Guns.

Using explosives to damage the Military Base forcefields only turns them off if you make a Traps roll. However, failing the roll instead turns the emitter invisible so that you can pass beside the field.

There are three computers in the Military Base related to forcefields that don't do much of anything, either because they try to affect a set of unused forcefields scripts, or fail to properly affect the ones in place, or both.

The mother deathclaw is identified as a "he" when examined. The game also refers to some robots as "he", while Dogmeat is called both "it" and "he". Deathclaw eggs are "he" and add to the "men" kill category when slain. 
How to finish the game in twenty minutes (if you hurry up)
Start a new character with PE 8, good IN and AG. Tag Unarmed, Lockpick and Speech. Run from the rats, leave the vault and travel west until you get to the Military Base (you may have to save a few times as you go).

Talk to the first guard you meet and go to see the Lieutenant. Refuse to tell him anything, and when he moves to hit you, run away. Go to the control room (save before going through the red forcefield). Stand behind the technician in the northeast corner and save. Use aimed blows to the head and try to knock him out; when you succeed, take his Robes and Security Card. If you set off the alarm, load. Wear the Robes. Use the card on the computer and trigger the 3-minute countdown. If done correctly the base should not be on alert, and you can just run all the way to the surface unmolested (but beware the red forcefields and chew a Stimpak or two). When you step on the exit grid you'll level up four times.

Travel south-southeast to the Cathedral and enter. Boost Lockpick to 100%, Science to 70% and Unarmed to 150%. Go to the top of the tower and take the Power Fist from the footlocker. Go down and enter the basement, open the secret door, bluff your way past the guards and go to level 3, then to level 4. Stand behind the mutant with the Gatling Laser and save. Equip the Power Fist, say you have permission from the Lieutenant to be armed and kill him with one or two aimed blows to the eyes. When the other one moves in, kill him too. Arm the bomb using Science. Return to the surface and step on the exit grid. The end! 
By taking advantage of the ability to keep A pressed to prevent critters from acting you can do this even faster, as demonstrated by Devin Herron. Firstly you don't need Robes to leave the Military Base, making that part considerably easier (get them from the Followers instead). Secondly you don't have to worry about mutant patrols on the world map. Thirdly you don't have to visit the tower for the Power Fist, since you don't have to fight the mutants guarding the bomb (this is easier if you pick up the Key in the base right after evading the Lieutenant).
The Fallout demo
A demo for Fallout was released containing something resembling a prototype Junktown, offering a different experience even for those who have played the full game. You'll notice some interesting details if you play about in the character editor, such as Small Frame giving AG +2 and Finesse raising your Critical Chance by 20%! Sequence is calculated as PE+AG and is raised by 5 if you take Night Person. This is pretty irrelevant though as you can only play the demo as the pre-defined character Max Stone.

You appear before the gates of Scrapheap, a minuscule community currently ruled by the Crypts gang. Waiting in the wings is the Fools gang, while the few unaligned residents would rather that the main character get rid of all the gangers. All is set for a minimalistic Yojimbo-type drama.

You'll notice there are quite a lot of interface issues, e.g. you can't save the game or access the options screen, you can't initiate combat without actually attacking, there's no carrying limit, there are odd messages such as "Wooden Wall was hit instead of You", and line of sight is a bit screwy (enemies shooting you through walls and whatnot). You can reload weapons, loot corpses and access inventory without using AP in combat. There's a different (uglier) typeface in the dialogue window, and the Pipboy doesn't do a whole lot.

Ways to finish the demo include: 
•	Kill either gang and talk to the leader of the other, whether or not you joined them. The game will end instantly. There are two exceptions in case you killed the Fools: if you're a Fool yourself Rayze will attack, and if you talked to him before and declined becoming a Crypt he will ignore you. 
•	Join either gang and agree to go scout the others out. Do so (you will know it's done when your Pipboy clue/quest entry disappears) and report back. Once the battle starts you can hang back and let them kill each other. Try to stay out of it for as long as possible (they tend to gang up on you as soon as you shoot someone) and finish off what's left. A little while after the battle is over you get a brief message and the game ends. You can also simply help kill the opposing team and talk to your leader as above. 
•	If at any time outside of combat there is no more than one member of each gang alive, it counts as defeating the gangs and the game ends. 
•	Steal the Wire Cutters from Skippy the Fool or kill him for them (don't talk to him before becoming a Fool unless you want a fight), then use them on the power generator in the Crypts house (250 xp). All remaining gangers will walk out of the village. You can either wait for them all to disappear or use your Repair skill on the generator to end the demo. 
Bits and pieces of info include: 
•	Stimpaks always restore 12 HP. 
•	There's some ammo in Phil's shack and an MP9 lying behind the bar in the Crypts house. You can use Sneak to unlock and loot the fridge for a Minigun and some other stuff. 
•	Take an Iguana-on-a-stick from the ice chest or the fridge and use it on the dog to gain a companion (and 200 inconsequential xp). Not nearly as good as Dogmeat, though. It's possible to plant items on the dog using Steal. 
•	You can use the computer in the Crypts house to play Fallout for 100 xp. 
•	You can kill the gate guards before going in and it won't change anything (if not they'll fight for the Crypts). 
•	Phrax will first warn you and then attack if you use any skill on the generator or try to pick the fridge. If you're already a Crypt, this often causes the Crypts to start shooting at each other - and you. Sneaking successfully will let you loot the fridge, but won't stop him turning hostile if you tamper with the generator. 
•	If you joined the Crypts you can switch sides by talking to Baka and passing a Speech check. 
•	There are two quests that appear in your Pipboy. "Scout out the Crypts for the Fools" is listed under the heading "Junktown". The other, "Stop the Gangs from attacking Adytum", is listed under "Boneyard" and appears when you start the gang war. Instead of being crossed out when they're no longer relevant they just disappear. 
•	Many dialogue nodes have a blank option at the bottom, some of which take you to the same place as the line directly above it and seem intended to enlarge the clickable area, others which allow you to leave dialogue prematurely. This doesn't have any special effect in most scripts, but could cause some oddities when talking to Baka. For instance, when you talk to her after joining the Crypts, you can avoid combat, or you could even avoid becoming a Fool after talking her into letting you join. Finally it will let you leave dialogue when talking to her after becoming a Fool to get your scouting assignment. Afterwards the script will assume you have the quest active and Baka will ask if you're done, but since you never got the quest you can't finish it. 
•	After you initiate the gang war but before combat starts, you can talk to Lex and call him a coward. He will technically join your party, but he won't follow you and will do nothing in combat except run away. 
•	If you ever wondered about the broken Pipboy button, it was supposed to read "Clues" and does so here. A pointless clue shows up if you agree to scout the Fools for the Crypts. 
•	The demo has the Ctrl-R recording mode available, and there are a few brief recordings to watch. 
•	The enclosed manual states there were to be fifteen areas in the full game; the extra three may have been two raider camps (Jackals and Vipers) and the Burrows as seen in the Fallout Bible. 
And thus ends the demo section. 
Things that will bug you severely if you've played Fallout 2
•	There's no "take all" button (argh). 
•	You can't move more than $999 at a time. 
•	You can't use Page Up and Page Down in your inventory (aaargh). 
•	New items go to the bottom of your inventory instead of the top (don't they have playtesters to catch this sort of thing?). 
•	You can't barter freely with party members. 
•	You can't tell party members to move out of the way (or anyone else). 
•	Party members can't change armour. 
•	Party members can't gain levels. 
•	There's nothing in the way of combat settings for party members. 
•	Party members move about a lot while you're trying to use healing skills or Steal on them. 
•	Did I mention some stuff about party members? 
•	Your destination on the world map is reset every time you have an encounter. 
•	The layout of Vault 15 is simply wrong! 
•	"Rest until morning" only goes to 6.00 even though a lot of people in the game consider 7.00 or 8.00 to be the start of business hours, which is usually what you're waiting for. 
•	You "take damage" when earning a level (because your current HP level doesn't go up). 
•	You need a perk to get green outlines around your NPCs in combat (oh yeah, that's worth a perk. How about you need a second level of the perk to get yellow outlines for critters outside your line of sight?). 
•	Money isn't displayed in dialogue. 
•	Carry Weight isn't displayed in inventory. 
•	There's no car, which means there's no trunk (but actually I don't have a problem with that). 
•	Using explosives from an active item slot doesn't drop the explosive (so why can you do it at all?). 
•	If you try to use something during combat, like opening a door or searching a corpse, your character will walk slowly up to it even if you have "always run" on. 
•	There are very few reputations, no special perks, very few ways of improving your character except for perks. 
•	You can't choose whether to avoid random encounters or not. 
•	There are time limits (although the most damaging one was removed by the patch). 
•	There is significantly less humour and what-the-heck playfulness (not all think this is a downside). 
•	As previously expounded, random skill checks and static skill starting values tend to reduce the difference between character types. 
•	The game is rather brief if you know where to go and what to do. 
•	Excessive looting is pointless since there's little to invest in (excessive looting should always be rewarded). 
•	You'll finish the game well before reaching the highest character levels unless you devote time exclusively to xp hunting. 
•	You can't keep playing after you've finished the game (well, maybe there's not a lot to do). 
Things that are better in Fallout
•	It's the groundbreaking original, or something (introducing radscorpions, perks, Nuka-Cola, talking heads, great voice acting, people's ribcages being torn apart, strange biological goo, and general post-apocalyptic mayhem). 
•	The world map is a lot more stylish and actually shows urban areas. 
•	There's one location where you have to worry about radiation (which means the total number of Rad-X you have to chew in all of the two games is equal to 2). 
•	You have a greater sense of the the plot actually going on around you (well... sometimes). 
•	Less out-of-character content and less orderly communities makes for a more condensed and consistent atmosphere. 
•	There are less bugs and less typos in the final patch (although there are many typographical deviations and punctuation glitches, especially in the Boneyard... and the Cathedral and Brotherhood are full of scripting glitches and unreachable dialogue paths...). 
•	Some data in the manual is spot on that is incorrect in the Fallout 2 manual, like the Master Trader and Small Frame descriptions, and the manual contains more detailed info overall. 
Unfinished business
There's actually some of this! 
•	Pipboy entries for several quest-like things done in Shady Sands, Junktown and the Hub. 
•	A gang war in the Boneyard, with the Blades as a regular gang instead of a bunch of wimps and Tangler as a big bad boss of the Rippers (you can hear about them in some tell-me-abouts). Related quests to join the Blades, stop the gangs from attacking Adytum, and rescue Zimmerman's son (Jason, not Josh) from the Rippers. 
•	A quest to deliver a Gold Locket from a Blade to an Adytum inhabitant. 
•	A Brotherhood miniquest to deliver Pulse Grenades from Michael to Sophia. Also more extended dialogue with Michael, and being able to con a Laser Pistol out of him. 
•	A Brotherhood spy quest. 
•	The Followers spy quest (it seems the name of the spy was Heather). 
•	A quest to deliver (perhaps unwittingly) a bomb to a Follower named Jake (you can ask Nicole about him). 
•	Being able to report Iguana Bob to the Hub police (really). 
•	Several named critters like a crone called Agatha in Shady Sands and a gambler called Hernandez in Junktown. Lots and lots in the Brotherhood and the Boneyard, several of which would have been able to raise various skills. 
•	Finding a Key in Vault 15 meant for... who knows what. 
•	Happy endings for the Followers (with a pic showing an unbroken wall) and the Hub (with a pic showing Iguana Bob), and mutant invasion endings for Junktown (with a pic showing Harry the super mutant) and the Brotherhood. 
•	In-game effects of mutant invasions of the Followers, Hub, Brotherhood, Junktown and Shady Sands. 
•	A super mutant named Rae who you could talk into killing the Master (in a movie sequence, no less). 
•	A Vipers raider camp. 
•	An area called the Burrows with intelligent raccoons that (luckily) never made it from the concept stage. 
•	A miniquest involving Billy and Dan in the Hub, which has been fully scripted but seemingly does not work. 
•	Finding the remains of an ambushed caravan along with the corpse of a Vault 13 scout turned super mutant. 
•	A clue index, mostly serving as reminders of known information, and a function to store video clips in your Pipboy. 
•	An unused "fire dance" death animation for children and midgets (it's used in Fallout 2). 
Top 3 most frequently asked Fallout questions
•	Q: How do I read holodisks?
A: In your inventory, click on the holodisk and select the hand icon. Then enter the Pipboy, click the status button and check the list of downloaded files on the right. 
•	Q: I saved the game in the Glow and every time I leave and move anywhere on the world map I die.
A: You've been seriously radiated. Either you didn't eat Rad-X to protect yourself, or you lingered too long. RadAway won't help you now, so if you saved the game in between soaking up lethal radiation and dying from it, you'll have to look for an earlier save and continue from there. You may be able to employ drugs to withstand the radiation damage (see table in Character Design). Failing all else you can use Falche to raise your stats, but remember to put things right again afterwards, or you will be (even more of) a dirty cheater. 
•	Q: I can't finish the spy quest among the Followers.
A: That's right. The people you would have to talk to in order to finish the quest aren't in the game.
