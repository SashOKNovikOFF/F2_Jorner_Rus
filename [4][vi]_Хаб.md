The Hub
"Rats? You've got to be kidding me."
"No, really. BIG rats!"
--Butch and the Vault Dweller
When you arrive here you'll see lots of people getting ready to leave with caravans. Depending on the time of day there will be one or two named ones: Mat, Luke or John (where's Mark?). Talking to Mat and asking about the carts will put Shady Sands, Junktown, Necropolis, the Brotherhood and (for some reason) the Glow on your world map. There are a few other people on this map who'll give you general information - Deputy Fry, Dan and Gunther. 
If you become an outlaw in the Hub, you won't be able to leave combat mode while on a map with living Hub cops on it.
Michal Burger chimes in: "Later, when you talk to Harold about what has happened to him, he mentions some guy that went with him to the Military Base, but was wounded and sent back to the surface. His name was Mark and when you ask what happened to him, Harold replies that he haven't heard about him ever since. So, that might be what has happened to Mark." Only thing is, that was 60 years ago according to the Fallout Bible timeline, but it could perhaps explain why there's no Mark Jr. around. A little bit of trivia...
Head downtown. At the Crimson Caravan you can take guard jobs. Caravans leave on the 3rd and 17th to Junktown, Necropolis, the Brotherhood and the Boneyard, and the pay is $600. Talk to Demetre again and tell him the caravans aren't ready yet and he'll give you a Frag Grenade. Keri is the one to talk to when the caravan is ready to leave. Male characters can hit on her: if you are a Berserker, or if you have CH 7 and make a CH check, you'll slip around the corner and she'll give you 1 Psycho, 1 Mentats and 1 Buffout afterwards.

General details on caravan jobs include: 
•	Talking to a caravan master after being cleared for work puts all of their destinations on the world map. 
•	If you work for the Crimson Caravan you will always have an encounter, otherwise the chance is 75% except for going to or from the Boneyard in which case the probability is 50%. Encounters vary greatly in difficulty and depend somewhat on route and employer. 
•	It doesn't matter one whit what you do during a caravan run. You can run from an encounter or kill some or all of the guards and brahmin (they won't fight back) and still get paid and get new jobs. 
•	When you arrive at your destination you'll have a choice between returning to the Hub with the caravan (same pay, you'll have two hours for sightseeing if you want) or staying put. 
•	Going back and forth will take 2-3 days from the time limit, but may take up to 20 days as measured by the calendar. See Irwin's quest below for a description of this timer bug. 
•	If you have the Mysterious Stranger perk, there will always be an additional caravan guard with 100 HP armed with an Assault Rifle. He will appear even if your regular stranger is dead, and killing him does not deprive you of the stranger. 
•	Caravan brahmin are all "talking" ones (see the Encounters section). 
There is a scripting bug that is common to all three caravan houses. Talk to the caravan master on the day a caravan is due to leave and say you want to go; then, when given a choice of destinations, change your mind. You can now go to the entrance of the Hub and collect your salary from a newly spawned caravan leader.
The Far Go Traders send out caravans on the 8th, 18th and 28th to Junktown, the Brotherhood and the Boneyard, paying $400 for each. Talk to Rutger to get the job once you've accepted quest 3, and the caravaneer in the same room when it's time to go. Butch will also put these locations on your world map plus Necropolis.

The librarian will sell you an infinite amount of books, and a Vault Location Holodisk for $750 ($500 if you make a CH or Barter check). The disk contains a pretty strong hint where to find the water chip. You can threaten her and get it for free if you make a ST check, but in that case you can't talk to her again which may hurt you later. Mitch sells Stimpaks and books very cheaply, but like most merchants he doesn't restock. Beth sells weapons and armour, though it's nothing you shouldn't have at this point. You get 15% off at Beth's if you took the quest for the Far Go Traders (see below). 
If you give or trade a Bag or Back Pack to Mrs Stapleton, this will stop the engine from purging books from her inventory at the end of conversation, and she'll get five more of each type every time you enter dialogue with her. This could be convenient if you want to trade lots of books at once for some very expensive item or set of items. You could also steal them. If a stack of books ends up beneath the Bag in her inventory - for instance if you moved all of them onto the table and back - it will go back to being treated normally, i.e. that kind of book will not replenish unless she has less than five.
Talk to Lorenzo and borrow $200. Then immediately return it, borrow $400 and so on, until you have $1000 from him. Now kill him and his two guards, and you'll be able to take $2034 more from the locker in the back and some other stuff from the shelves. The police don't mind. If you ask Lorenzo about the Children, he'll put the Boneyard on your world map; if you ask him about work he'll tell you about Decker. If you actually plan to pay him back, the interest is 10% a day on the original loan. After 10 days he'll be upset and want his money back; you can then try to fool him by giving him less money than what is owed, or even give him all you have (hint: drop all your money first). Lorenzo won't loan you any more money once you've failed to pay him back in time. 
Every time you talk to Lorenzo he will have $1000, $2000 or $3000 in his inventory (depending on how much you carry yourself); you can trade stuff to him if you plan on killing him later. He won't talk to you if you fought Decker's people or if you pissed off Kane.
If you talk to Lemmy outside the Maltese Falcon you can buy pointless info for lots of cash: a recommendation to Vance the chem dealer for $1000 (or $800 with good Barter or CH), a completely useless clue on water chips for $500 (or $400), and an equally useless clue on missing caravans for $300 (or $240). With a high ST you can intimidate him into giving you these snippets for free.

Irwin standing in a building at the bottom of the map wants you to clear out the raiders infesting his farm. He'll only ask you if you're level 5 or higher; unless you bring a couple of NPCs you should probably be level 9 or so. Once you agree, you're teleported to the farm. Beware that once you leave this place you can never come back, so don't save here unless you're confident you can take out the raiders. Kill them all, pick up 2 Stimpaks and 1 Metal Armor from the floor, then return to Irwin to collect a reward of one .223 Pistol! You also get 500 xp though it doesn't show in the message window. 
The journey to Irwin's farm and back takes about three weeks according to your Pipboy, yet you only lose two days from the time limit to find the water chip. Other timed events, like Lorenzo's deadlines or the Necropolis invasion, follow the calendar. There are other places in the game where you get this sort of discrepancy in conjunction with scripted map transitions, but you don't have to pay much heed to it.
You can buy Iguana-on-a-sticks from Bob. If you know what they're actually made of you can try a little blackmail and squeeze him for $50 to $200 every five days. This is worth 500 xp, but you'll have to wait five days before collecting your first payment, which takes some ST or CH as well. You can raise the amount by increments of $25 to $100, but if you go above $250 then you won't be able to talk him into giving you more money if he later decides he doesn't want to pay. Note that if you ever talk Bob into a fight, the Hub guards will attack you and not him. 
In v1.0 there was a bug so that you could collect your fee whenever you wanted and not just every five days.
Decker resides under the Maltese Falcon (where you can also gamble, same deal as in Junktown). Once you get the quest to kill Hightower (or Jain), you can go to Sheriff Greene and tell him about this. If you did kill the person in question and fail a Speech check, Greene will be suspicious and ask about your involvement, leading to another Speech check ("How dare you accuse me!" is your best reply here). If you fail that one too, Greene won't talk to you any more. If you passed either check, however, the sheriff will ask you to come along and kill Decker (and will in fact do nothing until you agree to do this). This battle is tough, not least because of Kane who has four attacks per round and hits hard. I'd recommend you have at least 50 HP and Combat Armor from Jacob before attempting this, or take 2 Psycho. You can't leave the hideout until Decker and Kane are both dead, but as soon as they are the others will surrender. You get $300 from the sheriff when you agree to go, $1000 and 1400 xp when it's all taken care of. Remember to go and loot Decker's place afterwards, and you can of course kill any remaining scum. 
If the sheriff didn't make it Kenny will give you the reward instead. In fact you can kill Greene and Fry in the fight and the police won't know you did it.
Ask Beth about Decker after you kill him and tell her you did it, and she'll give you 6 Stimpaks.
Kill Deputy Kenny and watch the message window.
In Old Town, Jacob sells stuff like Combat Armor and Sniper Rifles. He'll have a Super Sledge if you talk to him a second time (it's actually the weapon he's wielding to begin with). If you ask for something with "more punch", he'll put the Brotherhood and the Boneyard on your world map. Vance to the east sells chems (you may want some Rad-X before going to the Glow later, if you don't find it elsewhere), but he doesn't deal with just anyone who comes in the door. You can get a recommendation from Jacob if you ask him about RadAway, or from Lemmy by paying lots of money. With good Speech or CH you don't need one. Other ways to get at Vance's goods is to hit the barter button when he initiates dialogue the first time, or to kill him before he has a chance to do so (his stuff will then be in his corpse). 
In a crate to the right of where Jacob is standing you'll find a heap of Junk. This is actually a quest item which is used in two parts of the game, so if you grab this it might save you some running around later.
Just south of the exit grid there's a gang of four toughs guarding a prisoner, and they'll attack you on sight (you should be safe out in the street... most of the time). If you find this fight too hard, you could try to enlist the aid of the Hub police by hiding behind them and hoping the thugs will hit them accidentally. The prisoner will put the Brotherhood on your world map if you didn't already have it. You have to talk to him to free him.

In the southern Hub area you find the Water Merchants. Their boss will put Necropolis on your world map if you ask about the water chip (another hint). You can also get them to deliver water to your vault for $2000 ($1000 or $500 with good Barter). This earns you 100 days on the water chip time limit and 1000 xp, so go for it. They also send caravans to Junktown and the Boneyard on the 1st, 5th, 10th, 15th, 20th and 25th of each month, paying $200. Talk to the midget in the courtyard when the caravan is about to leave. 
Beware a grisly bug that can happen if you already finished the water chip quest. If you ever discussed paying for water caravans you can do so again after delivering the chip to the Overseer, earning the 1000 xp and reactivating the main quest, timer and all (but earning 100 more days on top of what you already had). You can also do this in the rare event that you never talked to the merchant boss before and did not fix the water pump in Necropolis (ask about a water chip and continue from there). For a way to exploit this bug, see the Vault 13 section.
In v1.0 buying water from the Water Merchants shortened the other time limit (the mutant threat) by 90 days if it was currently at 100 days or more, but this isn't a factor any more.
In the room to the south of the Water Merchants office you'll see a round patch on the wall; this is actually a weird door which can be opened and closed. Scary.
Thorndyke, the guy who looks like a doctor in the building to the northwest, will heal 15-25 HP for free every 24 hours if you let him, and talk about Unity and war. The guard beside him doesn't have much to say (you can only talk to him once, too). By the door there's a boy trying to give you a Flower. You can keep asking him questions until he walks away. If you try to enter the room with the bookcase, the guard will stop you. You can do it by sneaking. Jain is the robed woman; talking to her does little. 
IN<4: If you talk to Jain she'll attack.
1.	Dispose of Jain.

Talk to Kane after finishing quest 2 to see Decker again. You get $1000 up front if you talk to Kane and $4000 and 700 xp more when you return after killing Jain in the hospital. 
If you already killed Jain you get $1000 and 350 xp when you talk to Kane, but you must have finished the Hightower job successfully first.
2.	Dispose of merchant.

Talk to Kane in the Maltese Falcon, and if you killed either Gizmo or Killian or if you're a Berserker then he'll offer the job right away. Otherwise you have to know who Decker is (ask Beth about places to avoid). Either drop Lorenzo's or Loxley's name (but deny you belong to the Thieves' Circle), or tell Kane it's not any of his concern why you want to see Decker (if you pass a Speech check he'll let you in, but even if you fail you can then talk to him again and tell him the secret was about a job, and then he'll take you to see Decker). If you accept the job you'll get $500 when you talk to Kane again upstairs. Go to the Heights and kill Hightower and his wife. You get $2500 and 600 xp when you return to Kane. 
If you turn down a job from Decker, he'll kick you out and Kane will attack if you try to talk to him three times. In this quest and quest 1, if you forget to pick up your advance you'll still get it when you return after doing the job. Hey, honest crooks!
If you attack either of the Hightowers but leave the map without killing them, the rest of the outfit will disappear and Kane will be pissed. (Luckily they forget to pack the Necklace.) If you do this before getting the quest from Decker, you'll still get the quest but be unable to finish it. If you kill both Hightowers before talking to Kane, you won't get either of Decker's quests.
A slightly insignificant bug: if you antagonize Hightower's team you can pacify them by killing Dogmeat on the Heights map. Running onto the exit grid might be useful to end combat afterwards. The reason for the bug is that killing Dogmeat sets a map variable meant to let Phil know he can move back into his house in Junktown. This does not stop the Hightowers from leaving as described above.
3.	Find the missing caravans.

This is a quest where you talk to a lot of people. Go to the Far Go Traders. Talk to Rutger, then Butch. Take the job. Talk to Rutger again for a lead. Talk to Beth and she'll tell you to talk to Harold and/or Slappy. Well, go east, talk to Harold (you can get away with not giving him any money) and then to Slappy. Ask him to take you to see the deathclaw (800 xp). Talk to the deathclaw... actually, no. Now that deathclaw has 225 HP, so bring a friend or some good weaponry, and don't be afraid to chomp Stimpaks (you'll have hundreds anyway). After you kill it, talk to the mutant scout to gain a Mutant Transmissions holodisk and a Radio (or just kill him for 300 combat xp and take the stuff). Talk to Butch and tell him just about anything, then talk to Rutger, tell him it was mutants and show him the holodisk, and you'll get $800 and 1000 xp. If you need to go back to the cave, Slappy will take you there if you didn't already kill the deathclaw. 
In the unpatched version you reportedly got 800 xp every time you asked Slappy to take you to the cave.
4.	Steal necklace from the Merchants.

In the building to the south of Vance's place you find a staircase going down. Pick the doors and try not to step on the floor traps. Loxley is another treasure trove of Mark O'Green goodness; ask him if you can join the Circle and accept the assignment. You get 900 xp right away, as well as 1 Lock Picks, 2 Flares and 1 Nuka-Cola from Jasmine. If you go to Hightower during the day, he'll just kick you out (though you can give him $100, yay). Wait until nightfall and return. Go to the southern corner of the house, wait until the guard walks away, then enter the house. There's a trap on the strongbox where the Necklace is found, but no one will notice if you set it off. After you have the Necklace, return to the Circle and collect a reward of 500 xp, $3000 and an Electronic Lock Pick. This concludes your dealings with the Thieves' Circle. 
You can get the Necklace during the day if you want by taking advantage of the scripting. Open the door to Mr Hightower's office, then enter combat mode and take just three or four steps forward. As long as you're not standing directly inside the doorway Hightower won't react to your presence, so you can just take the Necklace and optionally talk to him on the way out.
By the way, Loxley and his gang are completely oblivious to Hightower being killed before, during or after your little raid.
If you don't pick up Jasmine's first batch o' stuff before delivering the Necklace you miss out on it.
