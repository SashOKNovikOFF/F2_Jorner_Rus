Brotherhood
"Do I have to sacrifice a puppie to join?"
--The Vault Dweller
Arriving here you can talk to Cabbot and get quest 1, which is one way of getting inside. However, with a good Lockpick skill and an Electronic Lock Pick you can open the door and go in, and everyone will treat you like an initiate. You can pick the door without the Electronic Lock Pick, but then the guards will turn hostile. 
IN<4: Talking to Darrel nets you a dose of Rad-X.
Inside you can talk to one of the guards by the entrance (and hit on her, though it won't lead anywhere). Go to the gym for some martial arts training, which will begin as soon as you enter the room. If you stay and watch you'll gain +5% Unarmed and +5% Melee Weapons in increments of one during the course of the session, and 500 xp if you got all five. Talk to Talus about equipment and you'll be able to check out Brotherhood Armor and three clips of a non-energy ammo type of your choice (he'll never give you any more ammo after that no matter how long you wait). Rhombus isn't much of a conversationalist and will kick you out of the bunker or attack you if you anger him. He can put the Hub and the Boneyard on your world map. Should you get kicked out, you can pick the door to get back in and no one will seem to remember that you were expelled (including Rhombus).

If you want to raid the large storeroom, which means you'll be at odds with the Brotherhood, one way is to unlock the door before turning the guards hostile. If you don't, you'll need an Electronic Lock Pick, since the guards inside will always initiate combat mode when you go near and prevent you from using your Lockpick skill on the door (but the Electronic Lock Pick can be used during combat). There's a lot of stuff to be found inside, including 2 Powered Armor, but you should have more than enough anyway and it's a pretty tough battle.

On level 2 you can raid the doctor's locker, get healed and de-radiated (for free) and perform weird surgery to increase some of your stats by 1 (for a price). Each operation also takes a lot of time, so check your calendar if you didn't deliver the Water Chip to your vault yet. Available options include: 
•	ST: $2000, 3 weeks 
•	PE: $4000, 1 week 
•	EN: $3000, 1 week 
•	IN: $6000, 3 weeks 
•	AG: $5000, 3 weeks 
You gain skill points based on your Intelligence when you first enter the character screen after levelling up. Thus if you don't view your character sheet at all for a few levels (but not more than three, or you'll miss a perk!) before raising your IN, you'll get skill points based retroactively on your new IN.
IN<4: You get the IN operation for $3000 and it only takes one week, but you don't get to choose any of the others (unless your IN went above 3, of course). If you want to keep your game stupid but still get the other stat rises, you'll have to use Mentats (one for each operation).
You can in fact get two IN rises, as long as you get the "smart" one first. Then use Psycho to lower your IN below 4 and talk to Lori to get the "stupid" rise. This would be a form of bug exploitation.
Depending on your current stats the EN and AG rises may do nothing except raise a few skills a little. On the other hand, you won't find many other places in the game where you can spend all the cash you've looted and traded for, and after you deliver the chip time doesn't matter much, either.
On level 3 you can talk to Kyle about power armour and agree to get a systolic motivator. You can get one from Michael if you bluff him and don't mention Kyle. Another one is kept in the locker in Rhombus' quarters. To get it, rest until Rhombus goes into the back room, then take one of these approaches: 
•	If you have an NPC, let them open the door by wandering so you can go through. 
•	If you are alone you can open the door without Rhombus noticing so long as he never caught you before. 
•	With a high Sneak skill and no followers you can open both the door and the locker quietly in Sneak mode. 
•	Continuously enter combat mode, starting outside the door and getting away with the loot before Rhombus can even get moving. 
If he heard you opening the locker, get the part and do any of the following: 
•	Put it in a bag or give it to an NPC; in this case you'll still have it after Rhombus throws you out of the room. 
•	Drop it on the ground and return for it once Rhombus is back in his bedroom. 
•	Hit A to enter combat mode as soon as you leave the loot interface and run out of the room before Rhombus sees you. 
If Rhombus catches you with the part it'll be returned to the locker (along with the part from Michael if you already got that!). Once you have the motivator, give it to Kyle (he'll give you a Deans Electronics) and use Repair or a Tool on the suit on the table. With a successful Repair check you get 500 xp and a set of Powered Armor. If you fail the check you need Repair 75% to try again. 
IN<4: If you're stupid and get caught by Rhombus, you'll enter a loop where Rhombus initiates dialogue and says the same thing over and over. To get out of this, hold down the A key and move away.
Also on level 3 you can talk to Sophia for a Brotherhood History disk if you want, and talk to Vree and ask about the mutants for a Vree's Experiment Disk, which could be very useful later on (you can also steal one from her). If you ask her about radiation she'll give you a dose of Rad-X, and if you ask about holodisks and computer skills she'll give you access to a computer which will raise your Science skill by 15%. Better raise it to 91% using books before that, but it matters little really. 
Vree won't talk to you if you get a bad reaction. Evil characters may be able to soften her up with Cult of Personality, which is about how useful that perk ever gets. You'd need to have the perk before talking to her for the very first time, though, and it's not available until level 12. Make sure she doesn't get blocked as she goes to the learning terminal, or you won't be able to use it.
On level 4 you can talk to Maxson and offer to scout the north for signs of the mutant threat. If you ask for weaponry then Mathia (a person of indeterminate gender) will let you choose between the following: 
•	1 Sniper Rifle 
•	1 Rocket Launcher 
•	1 Laser Pistol 
•	1 Power Fist 
•	1 Ripper 
You can also ask for $500 or $1000 and get it if you have good Barter (if not Maxson will throw you out), and you can in fact do this as many times as you want (why is it that this game presents you with so many opportunities to be greedy, when there are so few ways of spending the dough?). Once you've been to the Military Base (you can make a quick trip, enter the map and leave, preferably without your NPCs), return and tell him about the mutants for 1500 xp. (If you already blew up the base and tell him that instead you don't get the xp, but in that case just talk to him again and choose one of the other lines.) Next tell him the Brotherhood should attack the base, go talk to the Elders and you get 1500 xp again plus three Brotherhood paladins for when you return to the Military Base. 
The dialogue path where you first hesitate to take the scouting mission and then ask for $1000 is bugged, so that first of all you get the money if you fail a Barter check, and secondly you get $500 or $1000 this way depending on whether or not you asked for $1000 before (as long as you asked for $1000 at least once and passed the first Barter check to get to the "Take it or leave it" node, the $1000 flag will be set).
If you've already blown up the base when you get sent to talk to the Elders, you don't get their xp and there'll be another infinite dialogue bug. Enter combat mode to get out of this situation.
1.	Become an Initiate.

Cabbot will put the Glow on your world map, and the other knight will tell you about the radiation. Go there and pick up the Brotherhood Tape, return and give it to Cabbot for 2000 xp and access to the Brotherhood.
2.	Rescue Initiate from the Hub.

This one will be crossed out after you free the prisoner in the Hub even if you didn't get it yet. Talus on level 1 will give it to you if you ask for more firepower, but this isn't necessary. Talk to him after you rescue the prisoner to collect a reward of 1500 xp and one of the following:
•	1 Rocket Launcher 
•	1 Laser Pistol 
•	1 Super Sledge 
•	1 Powered Armor 

You'll only be offered the Powered Armor if your karma is 16 or higher. You'll probably want to go for the Powered Armor even if you have one, since you can get the other stuff anyway and the armour has the highest trade value (you'll be able to buy lots of books from Mrs Stapleton if you didn't already). Talk to Michael nearby to collect your reward. 
A glitch: if you ask for your first ammo and armour requisition after getting this reward but before checking it out from Michael, you'll only get two ammo clips instead of three. This is because the requisition sets the number of items to be checked out to four, instead of increasing it by four.
IN<4: Although Talus will know if you rescued the prisoner, you can't get the reward or the xp unless you get smart.
