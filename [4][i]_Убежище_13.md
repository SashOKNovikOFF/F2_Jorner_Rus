Vault 13
"Don't drink glowing water."
--The Vault Dweller
The game starts with a cutscene where the Overseer tells you to "be safe" as he's kicking you out of the vault. Right. There's a vault door but you can't get back in right away. Take the Knife and ammo from the corpse, then kill as many rats as you want for practice and leave. You can use the Knife to kill them, but I wouldn't worry about using the gun, if you tagged Small Guns at any rate. You'll find plenty of ammo.

What equipment you start with depends slightly on your tag skills. Every character will have: 
•	1 Knife 
•	1 10mm Pistol 
•	48 10mm JHP 
•	4 Stimpak 
•	2 Flare 
You may also find yourself carrying (in addition to the above): 
•	Small Guns: 24 10mm JHP 
•	Unarmed: Brass Knuckles 
•	Throwing: 2 Throwing Knife 
•	First Aid: 2 Stimpak 
•	Doctor: 1 First Aid Kit 
•	Steal and/or Lockpick: 1 Lock Picks 
•	Science: 2 Mentats, 2 Buffout 
•	Repair: 1 Tool 
•	Outdoorsman: 3 Water Flask 
If you pass the time until the clock reaches midnight, by resting in the cave after defeating all the rats or by moving around on the world map, you can enter the vault. The medic on level 1 will provide healing and remove radiation. If you hit him or kill any vault citizen he won't talk to you any more. 
IN<4: The medic will give you a Stimpak every time you talk to him. Infinite free Stimpaks!
On level 3, use Science on the computers in the room to the left for 350 xp from each - but if you fail an IN check you'll simply spend time "surfing the interweb" and gain nothing. Ask the guard at the armoury about locked doors (IN 6 and Speech needed) and tell her you need the stuff and she'll let you in.

The Overseer sits in the room to the right. You can talk to him and he'll basically tell you what remains to be done to move on with or finish the game, i.e. solve quests 2, 3 and 4. After you've talked to him a few times you can ask for more stuff and get 48 10mm JHP and 2 Stimpaks. 
You can turn on the people in Vault 13 and still carry on with the rest of the game, even finishing it. However, it's not possible to kill the Overseer by attacking him in the command centre. If you initiate dialogue with the Overseer when he's hostile, he'll fire and inflict 250 HP of damage, but all further attacks will be "normal".
1.	Calm the rebel faction.

Upset vault citizens on level 2 will tell you to come to Theresa's room at 17.00. You can actually go and talk to Theresa at any time and convince her the Overseer is right for 750 xp. This requires IN 6 and a Speech check and you only get one attempt, so save first. Another way to "finish" the quest is to kill Theresa (any rebels witnessing this will attack you), but you get no quest xp for this. Afterwards you can provoke any remaining upset citizens into attacking you, but you should know better. If you don't finish this quest within 100 days the rebel faction will indeed disappear from the vault.
2.	Destroy the Mutant leader.

This is a 10,000 xp quest that will get solved in a completely different location.
3.	Destroy the source of the Mutants.

Ditto.
4.	Find the Water Chip.

This is your main quest, initially at least. There'll be annoying cutscenes when 100 and 50 days remain of the 150-day time limit. Once you return with the chip, take it to the Overseer for 7500 xp. When this happens you won't be able to finish quests 1 and 5 any more (though they're crossed out on your quest list). You then get quests 2 and 3. 
This quest is not crucial to finishing the game, i.e. if you kill the Master and destroy the vats before the time limit runs out, you win the game.
A tip for item hoarders from Sebastian Cassten: "For keeping the Water Chip, simply press the 0 button when the Overseer asks you for it. Afterward you will be at the computer, gain the 7500 xp, lose the time limit, get the new quests from the Overseer and keep the chip." If you have a Bag or Back Pack below the Water Chip in your inventory list this will also keep the chip from disappearing.
There are two ways to "reset" this quest. The easiest is to talk to the Water Merchants (see the Hub). The other requires that you kept the chip: returning to Necropolis and using it on the water computer there will also undo the chip quest, which means you can give the Water Chip to the Overseer again for 7500 more xp. Using the cheat to keep the chip you could travel between the Hub and Vault 13, gaining 8500 xp each round trip and increasing the time limit all the while. Hours and hours of bug exploitation fun.
5.	Find the Water Thief.

Talk to Lyle or Cindy on level 2 or the water guard on level 3 after at least 30 days have passed and they'll tell you someone's stealing water. You must offer to help for this quest to become active. Go to level 3. Rest until midnight and a suspicious fellow will emerge from the elevator. Unless you talk to him he'll go into the storeroom and take some water (even if you're standing right next to him). You can then accost and search him and crack the case for 1000 xp. If you fail a CH check he'll attack and you'll only get 500 xp for killing him (unless the security officer comes running and kills him instead or an NPC deals the killing blow, in which case you get nothing). You can actually kill him as soon as you see him and get the 500 xp.
