Necropolis
"I am the bringer of death. Fall to your knees and beg for mercy... Or give me a sandwich, I'm pretty hungry."
--The Vault Dweller
You start out on a map with a derelict hotel. You can talk to a couple of ghouls, but it leads nowhere. The groaning ones will attack if you go too near; let them, and kill them. Once you're done, go down one of the three manholes. 
Ghouls on all three Necropolis maps will react if you try to loot their containers. This isn't so much of a problem on the first and third map where you basically want to kill everyone anyway, but on the middle one you may want to put off the looting until you've finished your dealings with Set. Most ghouls may radiate you if they hit you, but it's just the odd point.
There are four rats below, and a Cattle Prod on one of the corpses to the southeast. Go north to the exit grid. Talk to the ghoul and get quest 2. If you go north and east you find more rats, and a Plasma Pistol on a corpse. Take either of the two ladders up. If you take the northern one you'll find yourself in a passage connecting two trapped hidden doors. If you set off the nearest trap a ghoul guard outside might get hurt, but he won't turn hostile. 
You can use Traps or Lockpick repeatedly on either of the secret doors for 50 xp each time.
Find Set residing in his Hall of the Dead and talk to him to get quest 1. If you took the Water Chip but didn't repair the pump yet, he'll demand the chip (which will then return to the vault) or else you'll have to fight. Another option in this situation if you're carrying Junk is to offer to repair the pump; you'll then be teleported to the water shed along with Garret who won't like it if you try to leave without fixing the pump. 
If you talk to Set after killing the Master, he will be so happy he'll give you 40 Small Energy Cell, 50 Micro Fusion Cell, 1 Buffout, 1 Mentats, 2 Stimpaks, 2 Frag Grenades, 2 Plasma Grenades, 2 Pulse Grenades, 200 5mm JHP and 200 5mm AP (talk to Garret to get the stuff). As if you needed that at this stage of the proceedings, as the ancient saw goes. You can ask him about the vats instead, but he doesn't mark the base on the map and you miss the stuff.
Optionally take out the ghoul gangers to the southeast of the church. Go into the sewers again and go north.

Find the ladder and go up. There are two more manholes on this map that will take you to a different part of the sewers; go down and fetch the Junk from the northeast corner. Above ground you'll also find two robed people from the Children who will heal you for money (HP and poison), and a bunch of super mutants. Harry is the only one who'll react to your presence. To pass him, tell him you're a ghoul or a robot, or if you're a woman and pass a CH check you can charm him (in either case Speech will be involved). Going to see "Lou" will teleport you to the Military Base, which is a shortcut you'd not want to take in a normal game. Once you kill any of the super mutants the Children stop with the healing, and two days after you've killed all the mutants they disappear. 
Going to the Military Base takes 2 weeks according to the time limit and 4 weeks according to the calendar. If you already destroyed the base Harry will know and not try to take you there. Instead you can ask him what he's going to do about it and let him and his companions walk off the map. This counts as taking them out as far as quest 1 is concerned.
If you take the Junk back to the underground leader, he'll give you 3 Deans Electronics if your Repair is less than 60%.
You can get free healing from the Children by dropping all your money and agreeing to "donate all you can". There's a bug: if you try to haggle and then say you'll accept their price, you will exit dialogue and cannot talk to that person any more (the Junktown healer does not have this bug).
Each time you purchase healing from the Children, it lowers the Vault 13 invasion time limit by one day. Even if you're playing v1.0 this isn't a major problem.
You get 500 xp if you unlock the door to the cell with the ghoul in the same building as the mutants. Go down the manhole in the room next door, and down again. You'll have to fight two glowing ghouls. Enter the vault and take the elevator down. On level 2 there's nothing to do except fight some ghouls and take 2 Rad-X from a locker. On level 3 you can take the Water Chip by using the functional computer (if you're having problems, use Science first to get a bonus to your Repair check). You get 2500 xp for this minus 250 xp for each of the six super mutant guards you already killed. If you should have second thoughts, you can reinstall the chip by using it on the computer. Once you have the chip, the ghouls will sound threatening and attack if you didn't already fix the pump.

If you remove the Water Chip without fixing the pump, the ghouls in Necropolis will die of dehydration in seven days. If you enter the area 110 days after the start of the game (corresponding to 25 Mar 2162), or 30 days after killing all the super mutants at the watershed, and if the Master is still alive, the ghouls will be dead anyway (including the ones in the sewers, but not the ones in the vault) and there'll be three super mutant invaders on each of the three maps above ground. There's not so much to do about it except killing them. In the building with the ghoul gangers there'll be a refugee who can tell you what happened. 
Note that for each of the three maps the conditions for dehydration and/or invasion are checked only when you enter it, potentially resulting in discontinuities: it's possible to take the chip and have the watershed and hotel maps dry up, then replace the chip and find the church ghouls thriving; or you could enter one map and encounter invaders, then go and kill the Master and return to find the rest of the ghouls alive.
1.	Destroy the Super Mutants at the Watershed.

Talk to Set and don't piss him off. Kill the six super mutants (but not before getting the Water Chip). Return to Set during night hours and you'll get a reward from the fridge of... 4 Nuka-Cola, 4 Flare and $50. If Garret likes you you get $50, a Shotgun and 40 12 ga. Shotgun Shells instead, and if Garret really likes you you get both lesser rewards and $100 more (i.e. $200 in all). To get either of the good rewards you must have talked to Garret between 7.00 and 18.00 to get a reaction (high CH and karma help) but not bothered him overmuch after that. Except for the cash he takes the stuff directly from the fridge, so you cannot get more items by raiding it in advance. Afterwards you can piss Set off so you get to kill him and his bunch.
2.	Fix the Necropolis water pump.

You get this after talking to the leader of the underground ghouls. Get the Junk from the sewers and use it on the machinery in the northeastern corner of the water shed. If you pass a Repair check you'll fix it and gain 1000 xp; if you fail critically you'll lose the Junk and suffer 1 point of damage. (If you use Science or Repair on the pump after you fix it it'll say it's broken; this can be ignored.) When you return to the ghoul leader you get no additional reward, but at least you saved all the poor thirsty ghouls. For a while.
