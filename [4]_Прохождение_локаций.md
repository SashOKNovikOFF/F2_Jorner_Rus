Area walkthrough
"I know who you are. You are walking death, a plague in human form. Where you step, blood flows like a river."
--Lasher
Each area walkthrough follows roughly the same pattern: first a general run-down of important people to talk to and things to do that aren't technically quests, then a numbered list of quests just as they're presented in your Pipboy. This is not strictly a walkthrough in the "do this, then do that" sense, but there's enough information and general advice that you should be able to figure out how to do stuff, and have more fun in the process.

There are no "hidden" world map locations, i.e. they'll all be there for you to find even if you didn't hear about them from anyone.

There is, of course, one crucial time limit in the game, for returning with the Water Chip. After that there was a 500-day time limit in the original (before the mutants found Vault 13), which was removed by the patch. There's a hard-coded time limit of 13 years which you cannot avoid, but it shouldn't be much of a problem. Finally you must enter Necropolis within 110 days if you want to experience that area properly, which could be regarded as a time limit of sorts.

Here's a few hints and tips compiled into a handy list: 
•	Be polite. If you tell people you like to eat children they'll like you less. Most of them. Some may even refuse to speak with you further. 
•	Put away your weapon when you're not using it. Aside from the fact that you'll open doors faster, many more people than in Fallout 2 will react negatively to guns being shoved in their faces. 
•	Also many more people will be busy or sleeping during certain hours of the day, usually the night ones. 
•	Lots of times you only get one chance to talk to people; after you leave dialogue they might present you with different conversation options, or only give you floating dialogue. At other times you may only be able to access a specific thread once. 
•	Another big difference from Fallout 2 is that there are many more random skill and stat checks as opposed to fixed value requirements. For one thing, this tends to randomize the game and reduce the difference between various character types. For another thing, the threads where you must pass a check are often ones you cannot revisit. For this reason you might want to save before every conversation even if you know what you're doing. Not every skill check in the game will be listed in the guide. I've tried to catch non-Speech checks in dialogue; most others should be pretty obvious. 
•	Check bookcases, lockers etc. for stuff and take it. Places where you can get into trouble for trying to loot containers (Raiders, Necropolis, Razlo's bookcase) are mentioned in the walkthrough. Also look for items on the ground. I'll usually only list such loot if it's something special. 
•	Tell-me-abouts are only for additional flavour and information (usually trivial and/or already known), and never set variables or trigger events. You can forget about them completely if you want. Some talking heads have many extra sound clips for them, though - try asking Loxley about "boneyard" and "razor". 
•	Items on the ground or in corpses do not decay, so you can return and pick them up later on unless they're on a map you can't return to. However, to pick up an item you must be able to click on it, so if a dropped item (or a corpse) is completely hidden by opaque scenery then it will be lost. 
•	When bartering, the game never checks for weight. What's more, you cannot be "overloaded", so you can actually barter for more than you can carry and run around with it - but while you do you won't be able to pick anything up, even weightless stuff like Bottle Caps or Stimpaks. While not so useful for a solo character, this has a significant impact on the mule capacity of NPCs. 
It should be noted that not all dialogue options described in this walkthrough will be available to a character with middling ability or skill scores (typically IN or Speech). In some of these cases you can try chewing Mentats, if you have them. IN 7 is enough for virtually all important dialogue nodes.
A general cheat/bug... pressing 0 (zero) in any conversation will instantly end it. For instance, if someone says they're going to kill you, and you press 0, they may not turn hostile, or if you end up in a dialogue thread which leads only to an undesirable end, you can abort it entirely. Using this "trick" may prompt unexpected dialogue and cause quests to reset or abort - you have been warned.
Sean Meskill discovered a way to rest anywhere: "When you have enough status entries (names of locations) that they start to physically appear in the space where the alarm clock entries appear, then you can do the trick. Go someplace where you cannot rest. Enter the Pipboy. Press status. Press the alarm clock, then after it says you cannot rest here click a status item that physically corresponds to an alarm clock item. It will then switch to the rest menu, with the rest option that is in the same place as whatever status item you pressed being used. Usually you can't rest very long doing this, but you can do it as many times as you want. Very useful." Once the rest options appear, you have to click in between them. You need quest entries for at least three locations to be able to access the "Rest for ten minutes" option.
Here's a cheat from Michal Zalewski: "If you are at the brink of an impossible to win encounter, and have no other options, you can save your game, go to the main screen, hit Ctrl-R and load an arbitrary map, then load your game, walk past the combatants (they will not notice your proximity) and reach safety, save again, hit Ctrl-R and load the last save in the normal mode. Although it is cheating, it is sometimes a better option than replaying several hours of the game. If you feel particularly naughty, you can plant explosives near critters or kill them with Super Stimpaks. This also works if you want to avoid certain scripts. The method won't work if you have already entered combat mode. As a side note, there are some funny consequences to entering the combat mode while in Ctrl-R - most notably, it is possible to get killed, then walk away with negative HP. Quite unfortunately, you will still remain flagged as dead, so if you save the game and then load it in normal mode, the game will immediately end even if your HP is positive. The game may get mangled in Ctrl-R mode on some occasions (it is possible to crash it, or be stuck in endless combat mode), but it seems to be a rare glitch; once you get past Ctrl-R and load the save, there are no side effects as far as I could tell." Some scripts will still be active in Ctrl-R mode, e.g. a guard may prevent you from opening a door even if he won't attack. Experiment at your own risk...
