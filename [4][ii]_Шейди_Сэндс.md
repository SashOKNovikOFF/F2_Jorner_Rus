Shady Sands
"How about you and I... well, you know... get together."
"Listen... uh... but I... uh... I-I like guys, okay? Whew! Uh, excuse me, I got stuff to do."
--The Vault Dweller and Tandi
On your way to Vault 15 you'll come across a conspicuous settlement. Talk to Katrina by the gate for some game basics, and if you go through all the available dialogue options in one go you'll gain 250 xp. 
The first time I played the game my character was a female named Katrina. The first person I talked to in the whole game was Katrina. What are the odds? Her hints for the two local quests have been mixed up, so that if you've got the radscorpion quest you can ask her about Tandi's kidnapping and vice versa.
Razlo in the house to the southwest will tell you to stay away from his bookcase o' stuff. Save and try anyway. He and his wife will both give you two warnings before attacking, but with a little luck you can take all the stuff without either noticing. Razlo will heal you for money. You can also choose to barter for healing; if you leave the barter interface without trading for the healing object, he'll try to charge you in cash. Once you get a Scorpion Tail, give it to Razlo and he'll reward you with an Antidote and 250 xp. For each tail you give him he'll turn it into an Antidote, but it'll take some time. Next, use one Antidote on Jarvis in the back for 400 xp. 
You can get the medical barter items in your inventory by putting them in a container (see Raiders for a note on this). If you do this, Razlo will think you didn't buy the item and try to charge you in cash as usual. If you return later to buy healing carrying one or more such items, Razlo will consider this payment and then purge all of them from your inventory after you leave the barter interface (but not those inside bags, as usual). Which item he offers depends on how hurt you are when you talk to him, but each is good for a full heal.
After your first conversation with Razlo he will refuse to speak with you if you are a Childkiller or Berserker. However, he'll talk to you if you are currently doing either of the Shady Sands quests, if you carry a Scorpion Tail, or if you approach him after 19.00. I guess his aversion isn't that deeply rooted after all.
Talk to Ian in the house to the northeast. Unless you go out of your way to anger him he'll consider joining you for $100, but if you offer him "a piece of the action" (IN 6) and pass a Speech check he'll come along for free. If you get a good reaction (which at this early stage essentially means CH 9 and telling him you're sorry about his injury) he'll readily join you. It doesn't matter much since it will all be your stuff to redistribute anyway, including the $100; the tricky part about paying him is that you won't have any money at all when you first get here, so you'll have to steal or barter the sum from various peasants (and Ian himself). You get 100 xp when Ian joins you, and in any case he can reveal the locations of Junktown and the Hub.

If you talk to Tandi and manage a favourable reaction she can put Junktown on your world map and tell you a spooky story about the deathclaw. If you talk to the cook and pass a LK check you get to compliment her on her cooking and gain 1 karma. One of the kids running around this part of the settlement will be carrying a Red Ryder BB Gun to go with the BB's you find in a bookcase. 
Rock collectors ought to be disappointed with this game. There are 5 Rocks in a bookcase here and 5 more in Junktown... but that's it, except for Rocks carried around by children. Billy in the Hub has 5, and "generic" children - the ones found in both parts of Shady Sands, in Old Town in the Hub, in Adytum, and among the Blades - each amass 8-14 Rocks every time their map loads.
Over by the garden there's basically just one thing to do except pick stuff up (and toss caps into the well): talk to Curtis the farmer. You'll get 500 xp if you tell him about crop rotation. If you don't have the Science 40% needed for the speech option, you can get the xp by either entering and leaving the tell-me-about interface or entering and leaving the barter screen, even if you do nothing in either. This is seemingly because doing so triggers the script variable used to check if you told him. 
1.	Rescue Tandi from the Raiders.

If you spend two whole days outside of Shady Sands after dealing with the radscorpions and if Garl of the raiders is still alive when you return, Tandi will have been kidnapped. Seth will put Raiders on your world map, and Aradesh will give you a Spear. Talk to Razlo before leaving. If you tell him Tandi's been kidnapped and that you're looking for her, he'll give you 2 Stimpaks and 1 Fruit, and if you already delivered at least one tail to him you also get one Antidote. 
You can get two rescue kits from Razlo by talking to him before and after 19.00.
Go to the Raiders. Opening the door to Tandi's cell will alarm the guard in the corridor, so you'll probably have to talk to Garl. There are several ways to effect Tandi's release:
•	If Garl thinks you're his father you can tell him to release Tandi if you have IN 6 and pass a CH check or a Speech check. 
•	With Speech 45% you can attempt to threaten him (the "threat" line, not the "soul" line). 
•	Barter for her (she'll cost between $400 and $1100 depending on CH and Barter). If you leave the barter interface without "buying" her, Garl will attack. 
•	Fight him one on one (without weapons, Stimpaks and stuff). Despite what he says about the rules, he'll kill you if he knocks you out. If you win (talk to Garl after combat ends, or kill him), you'll get whatever was in Garl's inventory. Note that Garl does not return to the camp afterwards. 
•	Unlock Tandi's door, talk to her and fight your way out, or kill everyone and then release her. 
•	Use Sneak, unlock and open Tandi's door, talk to her and leave. 
Fighting Garl can be very easy or very hard depending on your stats; with a low Melee Damage you'll often do no damage, even though his armour is actually equivalent to leather and not metal. The best way to defeat him is to cripple one of his limbs or knock him out. If you have lots of AP you can use hit and run tactics: hit him once, then run to the other side of the enclosure. He'll follow you but not have enough AP to attack. Repeat until you get a few lucky criticals, optionally finish him off after he yields.
Sebastian Cassten relates a way to get Tandi's head in your inventory: "You need a Bag or Back Pack for this (if you're lucky you might encounter a Bag near Vault 15, else the closest one is in Junktown). Now when you are at the Raiders camp for freeing Tandi, ask Garl to barter for her release. On the barter screen, buy her head and put it in the bag. When ending the dialogue Garl won't attack and Tandi's barter head will remain. But Tandi isn't free yet. For freeing her you can talk to Garl again and barter, fight or talk her out of her cage. You can also keep on going with the Tandi trick and get more of them. The Tandi head weighs 10 pounds and looks very strange when throwing it on the ground. This also works with the Light, Medium and Heavy Healing you can get from Razlo." Once you've got the head you can talk to Garl with the head in your inventory and say nothing at all; Tandi will be released and you get to keep the head.
You get 500 xp for freeing Tandi, minus 50 xp for every raider you killed to free her (including if you killed Garl in single combat). She'll stick with you as an NPC until you deliver her back to Shady Sands (400 xp and $500 from Aradesh), but she's not overly useful. Strangely enough, if she dies on the way back the people in Shady Sands won't have a word to say on the subject. When you return to the raiders next time they'll be hostile no matter how you freed her. 
If you take Tandi to the east side of Shady Sands by way of the town map, you won't drop her off right away. If you then attack the peasants she may turn on you, or stand there watching. In either case, you get the 400 xp when you leave to the west side as long as you don't kill her.
2.	Stop the Radscorpions.

Talk to Seth to get to the radscorpion caves. One way of finishing the quest is to kill all the scorpions, which shouldn't be impossible (if you tagged Small Guns at any rate). Don't miss the stuff lying around: two clips of 10mm JHP, one 10mm AP and one Stimpak. Remember to take as many Scorpion Tails as you can carry back to Shady Sands, for Razlo. You get 500 xp when you've killed all nine of them.

The other way is to plant Dynamite near the wall section described as "weak" by the entrance, which can be done even after you kill all the scorpions. For this you'll gain an amount of xp equal to 75 plus 75 for each radscorpion still alive (they're each worth 110 combat xp) plus 500 if you didn't kill them all, but never less than 300 xp. This means you get 1250 xp if you just go in, blow up the place and leave, but killing the scorpions first yields more xp. Beware that if you're caught on the wrong side when the wall caves in, you're dead. 
IN<4: You can't get Seth to take you back to the caves once you kill all the scorpions, so bring the explosives right away if you want the bonus xp.
You set the timer on the explosives in your inventory and then drop it; time does not pass while you're in the inventory interface, so don't panic. Even with a puny Traps skill you can set the timer to the minimum of 10 seconds and run clear before the bomb goes off, whether you get the "explosive detonates prematurely" message or not. You can open a lot of (wooden) doors and forcefields in the game using explosives, but you shouldn't make a habit out of it.
